## PhoneLog Application

Starter code for the PhoneLog application.


### Git Summary

It is a good idea to commit and push regularly, not just when done.

```
(Check the status of your local repository)
cmd> git status
Changes not staged for commit:
    modified:  PhoneLog.java
    new file:  CallRecord.java

cmd> git add PhoneLog.java CallRecord.java

(commit with a descriptive message)
cmd> git commit -m "include a descriptive message"

(Now push all your updates to Github)
cmd> git push
```
